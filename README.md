# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Cyrielle

**Structural engineer** with skills in modeling, automation, and engineering data processing.

I work with **Python**, **VBA**, and **SQL** to develop tools for:
- Automating tasks in ETABS / SAP2000 using the CSI API
- Creating Excel calculation sheets with VBA
- Extracting and updating model data
- Modifying scripts and improving workflows

Iâ€™m also currently pursuing a **cybersecurity certification** with Google, expanding my technical versatility.

Open to **freelance and collaboration projects**, especially those involving structural design, scripting, or engineering tools.
